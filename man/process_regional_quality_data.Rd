\title{Process Regional Immunization Data Quality}
\usage{
process_regional_quality_data(.data)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{A data frame containing yearly immunization quality indicators.}
}
\value{
A tibble with class \code{pooled_regional_quality}, containing
summarized mean data quality percentages by year.
}
\description{
This function calculates yearly mean immunization data quality indicators
at the regional level. It summarizes quality data by year and returns
a tibble of class \code{pooled_regional_quality}.
}
\details{
The function computes averages for three key immunization data quality metrics:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Overall Data Quality (\code{overall})}: General assessment of data quality.
\item \strong{Vaccination-Only Data Quality (\code{overall_vacc_only})}: Data quality for reported vaccines only.
\item \strong{Tracer Vaccine Data Quality (\code{overall_vacc_tracer})}: Data quality for tracer vaccines.
}
}
\examples{
# Sample dataset
df <- data.frame(
  year = rep(2015:2022, each = 3),
  overall = runif(24, 60, 100),
  overall_vacc_only = runif(24, 50, 95),
  overall_vacc_tracer = runif(24, 40, 90)
)

# Process the data
processed_df <- process_regional_quality_data(df)

# Print the processed data
print(processed_df)
