\title{Process Regional Immunization Coverage Data}
\usage{
process_regional_coverage_data(.data)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{A data frame containing yearly immunization coverage indicators.}
}
\value{
A tibble with class \code{pooled_regional_coverage}, containing
summarized mean coverage percentages for different vaccines by year.
}
\description{
This function calculates yearly mean immunization coverage indicators
at the regional level. It summarizes coverage data by year and returns
a tibble of class \code{pooled_regional_coverage}.
}
\details{
The function computes averages for several immunization indicators,
including Measles-1, Penta-1 to Penta-3 dropout rates, ROTA-2, and BCG coverage.
